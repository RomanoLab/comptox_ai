# Security Policy

Thank you for helping to let us know if you discover a security issue in ComptoxAI!

As of now, ComptoxAI does not contain sensitive data in its knowledge base (e.g., nothing that could be deemed 'human subjects' research) and we do not control access via authentication. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any security vulnerabilities pose a threat to either us or our user base. Nonetheless, we are committed to producing the best user experience we can, and will diligently resolve any issue that could jeopardize that.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The preferred method of reporting security vulnerabilities in ComptoxAI is via submitting a new [Issue](https://github.com/JDRomano2/comptox_ai/issues/new). We will automatically be notified of your submission and will be able to keep track of our progress in finding a resolution.

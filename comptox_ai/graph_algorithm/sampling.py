Algorithms for sampling large directed graphs.

Many graph analysis techniques are intractable (or, at the least, inconvenient)
when graphs become large. ComptoxAI's graph is *very* large, and can therefore
benefit from sampling strategies that produce subgraphs which retain important
characteristics present in the parent graph.

A practical example of how graph sampling is used in ComptoxAI is for
generating a smaller graph to be used in unit testing. As a result, we can
perform a full suite of unit tests without the need to generate, transfer, or
load the entire database on CI systems.

We focus on techniques in particular described in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    method : str
        Name of the specific sampling algorithm to be used. As of now, the
        default option is the only available algorithm: {'forest-fire'}.

    Returns
    -------
    comptox_ai.graph.Graph
        A subgraph of the parent ComptoxAI graph.

    Notes
    -----
    
    This class wraps an arbitrary set of sampling algorithms, any of which can
    be used to fit specific scenarios. The default algorithm is the "forest
    fire" algorithm, originally described in [2]_.
